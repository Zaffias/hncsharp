Subject

We want to manage an IT company. For that, you have to design your own solution. Nevertheless, you must do it according these following rules.

 

Create at least :
 

Employee

Programmer in charge

Project Team

IT Company (main)

 

Employee is not really a class, is an interface with only basic methods.

 

the Programmer in charge, defines a Employee assigned to an activity, like coding something in a particular technology during a defined period.

 

The Project team's class, defines a group of programmers in charge. There is 2 differents types of teams. One where programmers are payed 100% of their salary,  and the other one at 50%.

 

IT Company, contains the main. It allows to manage all the previous defined entities.

 

How it works
 

Running the main, the IT Company data (a basic text file) must be loaded. If it doesn’t exist yet (Exceptions) , it must be created (see how to initialise the system). Once loaded (see how to load the system), data must be updated (see how to update the system), saved (see how to save the system), and finally reported (see how to report the system’s status).





 

how to initialize the system
 

2 project teams have to be created. In every team, 2 programmers in charge must be defined. This, representing the whole data system, must be saved in a text file (see how to save the system).

 

how to load the system
 

All the data is available in a text file. Read it (StringTokenizer, BufferedReader, FileReader),

and create the corresponding objects.

 

how to update the system
 

Increase the duration of all programmers in charge (+1 day)..

 

how to save the system
 

Design your own record structure (xml, json, whatever) and save the whole data (all created objects) in a text file.

 

 

 

how to report the system status
 

Layout :

 

IT COMPANY  - Report

 

nx = variable (like Integer)

 

IT Company is actually composed of n1 project teams, and n2 programmers.

this month, n3 days have been consummed by n4 programmers, and n5 days still in charge.
